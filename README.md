# convertmzmlwrapper
This repo contains some local convenience scripts around mzML converision tools

They are straight from a local installation, with various sorts of hardcoded
paths and probably *known* to not work out-of-the-box elsewhere. 

Currently, the scripts use singularity to execute (windows) based converters 
from Bruker (CompassXport) or Proteowizard (msconvert) in some containers. 
The converters themselves are not part of this repo.
